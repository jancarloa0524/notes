`document.createElement()` and `.appendChild()` is better than `document.write()` because you can conveniently and easily update it later in your code. `document.write()` also can't add to an element, unlike `.appendChild()`

`document.createElement()` does exactly as it implies, it creates an element, and combined with all the stuff from [](css.md)

`.insertBefore()` will insert elements before another element in your code.
